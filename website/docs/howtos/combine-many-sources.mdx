The getting started "Your first Gateway with Mesh" introduces the configuration of the Weather API Source.

In this page, we will see how to add 2 new sources to achieve the following Unified Schema:

<br />

<Graph>

graph TD;
subgraph AA [" "]
A[Mobile app];
B[Web app];
C[Node.js client];
end
subgraph BB [" "]
E[Books REST API];
F[Authors gRPC API];
G[Stores GraphQL API];
end
Z[Mesh Gateway GraphQL API];
A --> Z;
B --> Z;
C --> Z;
Z --> E;
Z --> F;
Z --> G;

</Graph>

<br />

We will go further than just add new Sources by shaping the Unified Schema to accept the following query:

```graphql
query getCityWeatherAndPopulation {
  city(city: "Paris", country: "France") {
    weatherHistory(
      endDate: "2022-01-31",
      key: "<YOUR_WEATHER_BIT_API_KEY>",
      startDate: "2022-01-01"
    ) {
      cityName
      data {
        temp
        datetime
      }
    }

    # population...
  }
}
```
