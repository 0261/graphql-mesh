Mesh [being installed](/docs/getting-started/installation), we can now build our first GraphQL Gateway.

Let's say that our ideal GraphQL Gateway Schema design incorporates 3 services: "City", "Population" and "Weather".


<Graph>

graph TD;
subgraph AA [Consumers]
A[Mobile app];
B[Web app];
C[Node.js client];
end
subgraph BB [Services]
E[City REST API];
F[Population GraphQL API];
G[Weather REST API];
end
Z[Mesh Gateway GraphQL API];
A --> Z;
B --> Z;
C --> Z;
Z --> E;
Z --> F;
Z --> G;

</Graph>

<br />
<br />

This page will guide you in creating a Mesh configuration to server the Weather REST API as a GraphQL Schema:


<Graph>

graph TD;
subgraph AA [Consumers]
A[Mobile app];
B[Web app];
C[Node.js client];
end
subgraph BB [Services]
G[Weather REST API];
end
Z[Mesh Gateway GraphQL API];
A --> Z;
B --> Z;
C --> Z;
Z --> G;

</Graph>


<br />
<br />

Creating a Mesh Gateway that combines multiple _Sources_ will be covered in the ["Setup a Gateway with many Sources" guide](/docs/guides/combine-many-sources).

## Building our Weather GraphQL API

<br />


### 1. A closer look at our Weather REST API

For our example, the Weather API will be the [WeatherBit.io](https://weatherBit.io) REST API.

To add WeatherBit's API as a _Source_ of our GraphQL Mesh configuration, we will need to get the API's definition.

Depending on the API type, many definition types will be available; for example, REST API tends to be described using Open API/Swagger or RAML.

Open API is a standard based on JSON Schema (JSON-based files standard) to describe APIs.

<br />

WeatherBit REST API provides an Open API definition on Guru APIs: [https://api.apis.guru/v2/specs/weatherbit.io/2.0.0/swagger.json](https://api.apis.guru/v2/specs/weatherbit.io/2.0.0/swagger.json).

We now established that our Weather API will require the `openapi` Mesh _Handler_ with the `@graphql-mesh/openapi` package.


<br />

### 2. Creating our Mesh configuration file

At the root of our project, let's create or update the `package.json` file by running the following:

<PackageInstall packages="graphql @graphql-mesh/cli @graphql-mesh/openapi" />


- `graphql` is a required peer dependency of GraphQL Mesh
- `@graphql-mesh/cli` provides everything to parse the configuration, execute the _Handlers_, _Transforms_ and serve the API
- `@graphql-mesh/openapi` is the _Handler_ of the "Weather" _Source_

<br />

Now, we can create a `.meshrc.yml` file with the following content:

```yml
sources:
  - name: Weather
    handler:
      openapi:
        source: https://api.apis.guru/v2/specs/weatherbit.io/2.0.0/swagger.json
```

The configuration is straightforward; we define a _Source_ called "weather" that is configured with the `openapi` _Handler_.

By providing the `source` URL, Mesh will be able to translate the OpenAPI JSON definition to a GraphQL Schema.

<br />

Let's start our GraphQL Gateway by running:

<PackageRun scripts="mesh dev" />

And open your favorite web browser at [http://0.0.0.0:4000/](http://0.0.0.0:4000/)

<br />

As expected, Mesh translated the Weather REST API to a GraphQL Schema, using the following rules:
- a `GET /api/helloWorld` endpoint becomes a Query similar to: `helloWorld(): String!`
- a `POST /api/sayHelloAll` endpoint becomes a Mutation similar to: `sayHelloAll(input: [SayHelloAllInput]): String`
- `PUT` and `DELETE` endpoints are also translated to GraphQL Mutations.

Which gives us the following Weather GraphQL Schema:

![Weather GraphQL Schema](/assets/docs/getting-started/your-first-mesh-gateway/mesh-weather-graphql.png)


<br />

### 3. Shaping the Unified Schema


We might not want to expose all those Queries in our _Unified Schema_.


Let's say that we want to **only keep** the `history(city: String!, country: String!, endDate: String!, key: String!, startDate: String!)` Query and **rename it** to `weatherHistory`.

To achieve such a final Schema design, we will leverage _Transforms_.

<br />


**Only keep the `history(...)` Query**

To remove all the queries from the Schema (except `history(...)`), we will install and configure the `filterSchema` _Transform_.

<PackageInstall packages="@graphql-mesh/transform-filter-schema" />

And update our Mesh configuration as follows:


```yml
sources:
  - name: Weather
    handler:
      openapi:
        source: https://api.apis.guru/v2/specs/weatherbit.io/2.0.0/swagger.json
transforms:
  - filterSchema:
      filters:
        - Query.history
```

We added a `transforms` key at the root of the configuration.

`transforms` value is an array of named transforms, ex: `filterSchema`.

`filterSchema` takes a `filters` option that accepts an array of filter rules.

By adding `Query.history`, we instruct Mesh to only keep the `history(...)` Query.

<br />

More information on the `filterSchema` _Transform_ on [its dedicated documentation page](/docs/transforms/filter-schema).


<p>&nbsp;</p>


**Rename the `history(...)` Query to `weatherHistory(...)`**

Finally, let's rename our `history` Query to `weatherHistory` by using the `rename` _Transform_.

<PackageInstall packages="@graphql-mesh/transform-rename" />

And update our Mesh configuration as follows:

```yml
sources:
  - name: Weather
    handler:
      openapi:
        source: https://api.apis.guru/v2/specs/weatherbit.io/2.0.0/swagger.json
transforms:
  - filterSchema:
      filters:
        - Query.history
  - rename:
      renames:
        - from:
            type: Query
            field: history
          to:
            type: Query
            field: weatherHistory
```

`rename` takes a `renames` option that accepts an array of `from`/`to` pairs.

Here, we indicate that `Query.history` should be renamed `Query.weatherHistory`.

<br />

More information on the `rename` _Transform_ on [its dedicated documentation page](/docs/transforms/rename).



<p>&nbsp;</p>

Our final _Unified Schema_ is now ready to be used:

![Weather GraphQL Unified Schema](/assets/docs/getting-started/your-first-mesh-gateway/mesh-weather-graphql-unified-schema.png)


The power of GraphQL Mesh, on top of providing an extensive range of _Handlers_, is to empower us to create well-designed GraphQL Schema using _Transforms_.

Keep in mind that a good GraphQL Schema design should:

- provides useful queries (not expose unnecessary ones)
- simplify the usage by providing the proper abstractions (ex: proper naming and hierarchy)
- provide specialized mutations that represent specific behaviors instead of CRUD mutations directly linked to an underlying data-schema

<br />

### 4. Customizing the server

Our GraphQL Gateway relies on WeatherBit, a usage-based and throttled API.

For this reason, we might want to add caching to avoid over-fetching data.

Let's add cache the `weatherHistory(...)` Query with a 1 hour expiration by using the `cache` _Transform_:

<PackageInstall packages="@graphql-mesh/transform-cache" />

And update our Mesh configuration as follows:

```yml
sources:
  - name: Weather
    handler:
      openapi:
        source: https://api.apis.guru/v2/specs/weatherbit.io/2.0.0/swagger.json
transforms:
  - filterSchema:
      filters:
        - Query.history
  - rename:
      renames:
        - from:
            type: Query
            field: history
          to:
            type: Query
            field: weatherHistory
  - cache:
      - field: Query.weatherHistory
        invalidate:
          ttl: 3600
```

<br />

More information on configuring and customizing the Mesh server is available in ["Configuring the Mesh server"](/docs/guides/customize-mesh-server).



<br />

### Our Weather GraphQL API is ready!

Congratulations! Our Weather REST API is now accessible through our Mesh GraphQL Gateway with:
- a comprehensive and tailored Schema design
- caching to avoid rate limiting from WeatherBit's API

You can now start again and play with the GraphQL Schema by running:

<PackageRun scripts="mesh dev" />

And open your favorite web browser at [http://0.0.0.0:4000/](http://0.0.0.0:4000/) and try the following Query:


```graphql
query ParisTemparatures {
  weatherHistory(
    city: "Paris",
    country: "France",
    endDate: "2022-01-31",
    key: "<YOUR_WEATHER_BIT_API_KEY>",
    startDate: "2022-01-01"
  ) {
    cityName
    data {
      temp
      datetime
    }
  }
}
```
